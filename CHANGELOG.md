## 2026.1.8

### Highlights
- Security: DMs locked down by default across providers; pairing-first + allowlist guidance.
- Sandbox: per-agent scope defaults + workspace access controls; tool/session isolation tuned.
- Agent loop: compaction, pruning, streaming, and error handling hardened.
- Providers: Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack reliability, threading, reactions, media, and retries improved.
- Control UI: logs tab, streaming stability, focus mode, and large-output rendering fixes.
- CLI/Gateway/Doctor: daemon/logs/status, auth migration, and diagnostics significantly expanded.

### Breaking
- **SECURITY (update ASAP):** inbound DMs are now **locked down by default** on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Discord/Slack.
  - Previously, if you didn’t configure an allowlist, your bot could be **open to anyone** (especially discoverable Telegram bots).
  - New default: DM pairing (`dmPolicy="pairing"` / `discord.dm.policy="pairing"` / `slack.dm.policy="pairing"`).
  - To keep old “open to everyone” behavior: set `dmPolicy="open"` and include `"*"` in the relevant `allowFrom` (Discord/Slack: `discord.dm.allowFrom` / `slack.dm.allowFrom`).
  - Approve requests via `clawdbot pairing list --provider <provider>` + `clawdbot pairing approve --provider <provider> <code>`.
- Sandbox: default `agent.sandbox.scope` to `"agent"` (one container/workspace per agent). Use `"session"` for per-session isolation; `"shared"` disables cross-session isolation.
- Timestamps in agent envelopes are now UTC (compact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ`); removed `messages.timestampPrefix`. Add `agent.userTimezone` to tell the model the user’s local time (system prompt only).
- Model config schema changes (auth profiles + model lists); doctor auto-migrates and the gateway rewrites legacy configs on startup.
- Commands: gate all slash commands to authorized senders; add `/compact` to manually compact session context.
- Groups: `whatsapp.groups`, `telegram.groups`, and `imessage.groups` now act as allowlists when set. Add `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior.
- Auto-reply: removed `autoReply` from Discord/Slack/Telegram channel configs; use `requireMention` instead (Telegram topics now support `requireMention` overrides).
- CLI: remove `update`, `gateway-daemon`, `gateway {install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|daemon status|wake|send|agent}`, and `telegram` commands; move `login/logout` to `providers login/logout` (top-level aliases hidden); use `daemon` for service control, `send`/`agent`/`wake` for RPC, and `nodes canvas` for canvas ops.

### Fixes
- **CLI/Gateway/Doctor:** daemon runtime selection + improved logs/status/health/errors; auth/password handling for local CLI; richer close/timeout details; auto-migrate legacy config/sessions/state; integrity checks + repair prompts; `--yes`/`--non-interactive`; `--deep` gateway scans; better restart/service hints.
- **Agent loop + compaction:** compaction/pruning tuning, overflow handling, safer bootstrap context, and per-provider threading/confirmations; opt-in tool-result pruning + compact tracking.
- **Sandbox + tools:** per-agent sandbox overrides, workspaceAccess controls, session tool visibility, tool policy overrides, process isolation, and tool schema/timeout/reaction unification.
- **Providers (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/Signal/iMessage):** retry/backoff, threading, reactions, media groups/attachments, mention gating, typing behavior, and error/log stability; long polling + forum topic isolation for Telegram.
- **Gateway/CLI UX:** `clawdbot logs`, cron list colors/aliases, docs search, agents list/add/delete flows, status usage snapshots, runtime/auth source display, and `/status`/commands auth unification.
- **Control UI/Web:** logs tab, focus mode polish, config form resilience, streaming stability, tool output caps, windowed chat history, and reconnect/password URL auth.
- **macOS/Android/TUI/Build:** macOS gateway races, QR bundling, JSON5 config safety, Voice Wake hardening; Android EXIF rotation + APK naming/versioning; TUI key handling; tooling/bundling fixes.
- **Packaging/compat:** npm dist folder coverage, Node 25 qrcode-terminal import fixes, Bun/Playwright/WebSocket patches, and Docker Bun install.
- **Docs:** new FAQ/ClawdHub/config examples/showcase entries and clarified auth, sandbox, and systemd docs.

### Maintenance
- Skills additions (Himalaya email, CodexBar, 1Password).
- Dependency refreshes (pi-* stack, Slack SDK, discord-api-types, file-type, zod, Biome, Vite).
- Refactors: centralized group allowlist/mention policy; lint/import cleanup; switch tsx → bun for TS execution.

## 2026.1.5

### Highlights
- Models: add image-specific model config (`agent.imageModel` + fallbacks) and scan support.
- Agent tools: new `image` tool routed to the image model (when configured).
- Config: default model shorthands (`opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt`, `gpt-mini`, `gemini`, `gemini-flash`).
- Docs: document built-in model shorthands + precedence (user config wins).
- Bun: optional local install/build workflow without maintaining a Bun lockfile (see `docs/bun.md`).

### Fixes
- Control UI: render Markdown in tool result cards.
- Control UI: prevent overlapping action buttons in Discord guild rules on narrow layouts.
- Android: tapping the foreground service notification brings the app to the front. (#179) — thanks @Syhids
- Cron tool uses `id` for update/remove/run/runs (aligns with gateway params). (#180) — thanks @adamgall
- Control UI: chat view uses page scroll with sticky header/sidebar and fixed composer (no inner scroll frame).
- macOS: treat location permission as always-only to avoid iOS-only enums. (#165) — thanks @Nachx639
- macOS: make generated gateway protocol models `Sendable` for Swift 6 strict concurrency. (#195) — thanks @andranik-sahakyan
- macOS: bundle QR code renderer modules so DMG gateway boot doesn't crash on missing qrcode-terminal vendor files.
- macOS: parse JSON5 config safely to avoid wiping user settings when comments are present.
- WhatsApp: suppress typing indicator during heartbeat background tasks. (#190) — thanks @mcinteerj
- WhatsApp: mark offline history sync messages as read without auto-reply. (#193) — thanks @mcinteerj
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when a provider emits late streaming `text_end` events (OpenAI/GPT).
- CLI: use tailnet IP for local gateway calls when bind is tailnet/auto (fixes #176).
- Env: load global `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/.env` (`~/.clawdbot/.env`) as a fallback after CWD `.env`.
- Env: optional login-shell env fallback (opt-in; imports expected keys without overriding existing env).
- Agent tools: OpenAI-compatible tool JSON Schemas (fix `browser`, normalize union schemas).
- Onboarding: when running from source, auto-build missing Control UI assets (`bun run ui:build`).
- Discord/Slack: route reaction + system notifications to the correct session (no main-session bleed).
- Agent tools: honor `agent.tools` allow/deny policy even when sandbox is off.
- Discord: avoid duplicate replies when OpenAI emits repeated `message_end` events.
- Commands: unify /status (inline) and command auth across providers; group bypass for authorized control commands; remove Discord /clawd slash handler.
- CLI: run `clawdbot agent` via the Gateway by default; use `--local` to force embedded mode.
